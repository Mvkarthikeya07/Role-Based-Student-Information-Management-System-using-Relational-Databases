🎓 Role-Based Student Information Management System using Relational Databases

A Role-Based Database Management System for Academic Institutions

📌 Overview

The Student Management System is a database-driven web application designed to manage student records efficiently through a role-based access control system. The application enables secure login for teachers and students, allowing controlled access to academic records stored in a relational database.

This project was developed as part of an industrial internship, focusing on Database Management Systems (DBMS) and IT-enabled enterprise systems, demonstrating how backend databases integrate with web-based interfaces in real-world organizational environments.

🏢 Internship & Project Details

Organization: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (Vizag Steel Plant)

Department: IT & ERP Department

Project Title: Database Management System

Duration: 4 Weeks
(December 6, 2024 – January 31, 2025)

Domain: DBMS + IT Systems

This project reflects practical exposure to enterprise-level data handling, role-based access, and IT system workflows used in large-scale organizations.

🎯 Objectives

Design a secure, role-based student information system

Implement CRUD operations using a relational database

Apply authentication and authorization mechanisms

Integrate backend database logic with a web interface

Demonstrate practical DBMS concepts in an enterprise context

🚀 Key Features

✔ Role-based login (Teacher & Student)
✔ Secure authentication system
✔ Teacher dashboard for managing student records
✔ Student dashboard for viewing assigned data
✔ Database-backed persistent storage
✔ Search, edit, delete, and export functionality
